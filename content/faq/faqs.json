    {
      "question": "What can I sign and store?",
      "answer": "We started off by targeting generic release artifacts like tarballs, compiled binaries and container images, but our future aim is to explore other formats like jars, and manifest signing like SBOM. We’re also looking to collaborate with package managers and ease the adoption of signing for their communities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any privacy issues?",
      "answer": "No. The only personal data sigstore uses is provided from an OpenID Connect grant, and even that’s as lean as it can be (just the user’s email address) - there’s no need to access contacts, email contents, cloud drives or calendars. Just what’s necessary to map a signing event to someone who has access to an identity provider account, which allows for a trust root."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the current status?",
      "answer": "We’re working hard to release v1.0 in July. At the time of writing, we have a working transparency log that’s fully operational as a standalone service, Rekor. It consists of a server and client tooling to make entries and query for inclusion. Files are available to run this in GKE. Work’s also underway to mature the WebPKI (Fulcio) and develop client tools for different package managers and upstream communities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can people get involved?",
      "answer": "The best way is to try out the technologies and let us know how you get on - it’ll help us keep developing sigstore’s functionality and see where we can improve. It grows the community too, and we’d always welcome new members to the working group over on Slack. You can also follow us @projectsigstore or the blog for updates, or join the mailing list at sigstore-dev@googlegroups.com."
    },
    {
      "question": "What security checks do you use internally?",
      "answer": "We’ve adopted a security disclosures and response policy to make sure we can responsibly handle critical issues. We have an initial Security Response Committee, who for each vulnerability reported will coordinate to create the fix and release, and keep the committee looped in. The policy in full is here: <https://github.com/sigstore/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md>"
    },
    {
      "question": "How easy is it to use?",
      "answer": "As easy as we can make it. Signing and verifying seems like a lot of extra effort with a lot of pitfalls. Our aim is to design away the manual effort and risk of error, automating the signing into a few simple commands. Verification checks can be made much easier by using the data in our transparency logs, and work is currently underway to explore integrations and development to support that."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there live support?",
      "answer": "The fastest way to get answers, ideas and feedback is to jump into our working group on Slack. We’re all developing this together, so we’d be happy to help you out."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I run my own monitor?",
      "answer": "We would love that, you’re definitely encouraged to do so. The more people monitoring the logs and providing useful services to users, the better. We’ve published OpenAPI interfaces for both Rekor and Fulcio, and our Slack workspace is a good place to run ideas by us for feedback and questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use the transparency log on its own?",
      "answer": "Yes. Anyone can stand up a Rekor instance, if you perform your own signing. Rekor has a pluggable PKI and support for GPG, X.509 and Minisign. It also has a customizable manifest schema (plugable types), so you can get it to work with whatever values you need. There’s more details in our documentation about plugable types, and you can find information on the Rekor client CLI for adding an entry to a transparency log."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why not blockchain?",
      "answer": "Public blockchains often end up using a centralized entry point for canonicalization and authentication. Consensus algorithms can be susceptible to majority attacks, and transparency logs are more mature and capable for what we aim to build with sigstore."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Sigstore integrate in-toto?",
      "answer": "Sigstore is co-led by Santiago Torres-Arias, the lead of the in-toto project, and the two efforts are complementary. Sigstore supports and uses in-toto in a number of ways. Cosign can be used to generate and verify in-toto attestations and Rekor can store those attestations. in-toto also supports the use of PKI semantics for signing metadata which will be used in future to support Fulcio for developer key management."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Sigstore use / interact with TUF?",
      "answer": "Sigstore's root of trust for Fulcio and Rekor are distributed using TUF.  The releases for Cosign, Rekor, and Fulcio are also signed by a key distributed with TUF.  The projects solve a similar problem of signing and verifying software that will be distributed via a repository. Sigstore provides key signing using multiple techniques, including without requiring developers to manage keys by using OIDC.  In contrast, TUF typically requires keys to be managed by developers, but addresses a threat model where all online servers and keys could be compromised.  The projects are collaborating and can be used cooperatively.  More guidance on this will be forthcoming as the communities collaborate on their first large co-deployments. "

    {
      "question": "Do you plan on running a monitor?",
      "answer": "Yes, eventually. A monitor prototype is currently being worked on by some collaborators from Purdue University."
